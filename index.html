The people move. They do not stay.  
The sky forgets. The roots betray.  
There are ruins too new to rot,  
And scripts that living hands wrote not.

Bone-altars drip with blood still warm...  
No tracks, no sign, no beast, no swarm.

Those who dig may never return.  
Those who do bring back what burns.  
So most agree, with breath held tight:  
Keep walking. Don’t look left or right.`);" title="The Sixth Era: The Now Unfolding">

But the Ygrahn were waiting. The conifers swallowed the first assault. Roots bloomed from blood, and vines dragged screaming soldiers into crevices that hadn’t existed the day before. The second wave used fire. They burned the trees, and with it, the scorchwell. It is said that both gods, the Root and the Maw, took offense.  
  
Three nights later, ash fell in the Pale Expanse like snow. Every magistrate who authorized the war coughed up seedlings while they slept comfortably in Vul-Kesh, half way across the world.`, 'images/ashwake.png'); }" title="Ash Wake at Drazhthunek">
